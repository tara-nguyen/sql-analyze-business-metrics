# How to Analyze Business Metrics with SQL

### Advanced Aggregates

At the heart of every great business decision is data. Since most businesses store critical data in SQL databases, a deep understanding of SQL is a necessary skill for every data analyst. Chief among data analysis tasks is **data aggregation**, the grouping of data to express in summary form.

### Common Metrics

As a data scientist, when youâ€™re not investigating spikes or dips in your data, you might be building dashboards of KPIs, or *key performance indicators* for a company. While every business has different metrics to track their success, most are based on revenue and usage.

Some common metrics:

- *Daily Revenue*: the sum of money made per day;

- *Daily Active Users*: the number of unique users seen each day;

- *Daily Average Revenue Per Purchasing User (ARPPU)*: the average amount of money spent by purchasers each day;

- *Daily Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)*: the average amount of money across all users; and

- *1 Day Retention*: the number of players from Day N who came back to play again on Day N+1.
